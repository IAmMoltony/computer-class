This repository hosts all sample code from my 8th grade computer class textbook.

None of the scripts were modified except for adding a comment at the beginning of each script
explaining what it does, how to use it and what error(s) it has.

Note that some scripts are not runnable due to incorrect indentation and other syntax errors.
